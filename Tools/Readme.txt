Make idnum tables from itemInfo:
1)Copy itemInfo.lub to "SeperateItemInfo" Folder, If you have .lua, just change the extension to .lub
2)If you have lua installed, just double-click "SeperateItemInfo.lua" and it will do the work.
3)If you don't have lua installed, open command prompt, go to "SeperateItemInfo" Folder, and type the following command "lua SeperateItemInfo.lua"
4)The files will be stored in "idnum" folder.
Note: This can even convert the compiled .lub file to idnum table
